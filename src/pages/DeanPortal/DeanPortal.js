Following the basics, the course then focuses on building blocks of web application development i.e.  an introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Having grip on fundamentals the course moves to advance concepts of JavaScript like prototyping, asynchronous program execution, ES6 standard. The course then discusses Bootstrap Framework that is essential to building responsive web applications. Owing to the market trend the course shall discuss latest approaches and trends in the field of web development, and shall also introduce the students to modern web communication strategies (such as REST, GraphQL) and service oriented architecture. And finally, the course dives into Full Stack Web Development consisting of a detailed view into a frontend framework, backend framework, and a NoSQL Database.",

Increasing size and complexity of software, together with more demanding users, means the consequences of failure are increasingly severe. Programming is only one of a range of activities necessary for the development of software, which is a challenging process that meets customer needs. The rest of the activities are: planning and acquiring resources for the project; investigating the business and technical contexts for the system; eliciting and documenting user requirements; creating a design for the system; and integrating, verifying and deploying the completed components. This course provides with an understanding of the major challenges inherent in real software development, and with some of the tools and techniques that can be used in their attainment.",
